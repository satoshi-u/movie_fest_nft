Create a non-fungible token that represents tickets for a festival and a fungible currency token using the chain technology of your choice (Solidity, Chaincode, Cordapp, ...)

- There are maximum 1000 tickets
- You can buy tickets from the organizer at a fixed price in the currency token
- You can buy for and sell tickets to others, but the price can never be higher than 110% of the previous sale
- Add a monetization option for the organizer in the secondary market sales

Minimal requirements:
- Documentation is everything, explain what happens and how to run/deploy
- A basic script or test case to cover the main flow. 

Delivery -
- Share the github link of your project.
